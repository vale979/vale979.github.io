Hello! I am **Valerian Pratama**. I graduated with bachelor degree in mathematics from Institut Teknologi Bandung in 2021 and with master degree in mathematics from Institut Teknologi Bandung in October 2022. As of December 2025, I am working as a data engineer at a financial company.

For my undergraduate thesis, I wrote an exposition on Eilenberg-MacLane space. This is a topological space with only one nontrivial homotopy group. On the thesis, I showed the existence of such spaces and the fact that for sufficiently well-behaved space (well, in this case it's CW complex), it's unique up to weak homotopy equivalence. For my master thesis, I learnt about simplicial sets and some simplicial homotopy theory to bridge construction for quasicategory -- a certain model for $\infty$-category.

Outside of mathematics, I like to play tower defense game (mainly Arknights), hiking/camping (still learning to do it solo!), running (especially trail), and listening to music (mainly JPop/Mandopop -- although I can't speak either Japanese or Chinese lol). My main fandom currently is LoveLive (especially Hasunosora), Vocaloid, and Gakuen Idolm@ster. My favourite music group is Cerise Bouquet.


All opinion in this blog, unless explicitly stated otherwise, is strictly mine.
