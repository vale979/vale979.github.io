      <description>&lt;p&gt;One year ago, I decided that I will give trail running a try. Mind you, myself in 2024 was not really a runner. My tempo pace was freakin&amp;rsquo; 11&amp;rsquo;/km! I also cramped running a 1h15m 7K race lol. However, in order to suffer less when hiking, I think I need to get fitter. So, I started running. And what is better than giving yourself a target, an anchor, so you can measure your progress? Yes, a race! Siksorogo was surely a very popular race, even when I was not a trail runner back then, I already heard the name. I checked the details of the race and saw that it&amp;rsquo;s around 15km with elevation gain of around 1000m and 6h cutoff time. Seems like a realistic target for me. So, I vowed to myself that in 2025 I will be fit enough to complete this race.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
